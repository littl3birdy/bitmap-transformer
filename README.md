Building a bitmap transformer CLI

This was a 1 day lab challenge at the beginning of our Java training in Code Fellows. We had about 3 hours to figure out how to transform a bitmap file in 3 different ways, using our very beginner java skills. 

## Feature: Create new bitmap instance
### Estimated time:
30 minutes
### Start time: 
10:40am
### End time:
10:45am
### Actual time to complete:
5 minutes

## Feature: Black and White
### Estimated time:
2 hours
### Start time: 
10:50am
### End time:
1:37pm
### Actual time to complete:
2 hours (-47 minute lunch)

## Feature: Blueify 
### Estimated time:
1 hour
### Start time: 
2:00pm
### End time:
3:00pm
### Actual time to complete:
1 hour

## Feature: Mirror
### Estimated time:
30 minutes
### Start time: 
9:20am
### End time:
9:47am
### Actual time to complete:
27 minutes

To test this code, create three Bitmap instances, using the same inputPath, but utilizing different outputPath(s) and newName(s). This will allow you to see the bitmap saved based on different paths and with different names.

Use another inputPath to test how the transform method works on a different bmp image.
